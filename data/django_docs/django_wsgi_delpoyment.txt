PURPOSE: Explain the fundamentals of deploying Django using the WSGI interface, including the application object, settings configuration, and middleware application.
DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
WSGI is Django's primary synchronous deployment platform.
startproject creates a default WSGI configuration in <project_name>/wsgi.py.
Supported production WSGI servers:

Gunicorn
uWSGI
Apache with mod_wsgi

CONCEPT: The application callable
WSGI servers communicate via an application callable.
Located in <project_name>/wsgi.py:
CODE:
Example content (generated by startproject)
application = get_wsgi_application()
Used by both development server and production deployments.
Servers load it based on configuration.
runserver uses WSGI_APPLICATION setting (defaults to <project_name>.wsgi.application).
CONCEPT: Settings module configuration
Django imports settings via DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable (dotted path).
Default wsgi.py sets to mysite.settings if unset.
Use different values for development/production.
In multi-site setups (e.g., mod_wsgi), set explicitly in wsgi.py:
CODE:
import os
os.environ["DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"] = "mysite.settings"
CONCEPT: Applying WSGI middleware
Wrap the application object in wsgi.py:
CODE:
from some_package import SomeMiddleware

application = SomeMiddleware(application)
Or create custom WSGI application delegating to Django's.

SUMMARY:

Use the generated wsgi.py as entry point.
Configure DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE appropriately.
Apply middleware by wrapping the application callable.
Choose production server (Gunicorn/uWSGI/Apache common).
