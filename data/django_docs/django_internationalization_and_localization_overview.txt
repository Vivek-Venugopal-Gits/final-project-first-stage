SECTION: Internationalization and Localization in Django

PURPOSE:
Explain how Django enables applications to support multiple languages, locales, and cultural formats.

DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
APPLICABILITY:

Applies to Django 6.0 and compatible versions that support internationalization features.

SECTION: Overview of Internationalization and Localization

PURPOSE:
Describe the goals and core responsibilities of internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in Django.

CONCEPT:

Internationalization and localization allow a single web application to present content in languages and formats appropriate for different audiences.

Django provides built-in support for:

Translation of text.

Formatting of dates, times, and numbers.

Time zone handling.

Django’s workflow is based on two responsibilities:

Developers and template authors explicitly mark content that must be translated or localized.

Django applies localization rules based on user preferences.

Language preferences are typically derived from the browser’s Accept-Language HTTP header. Time zone information is not automatically provided by browsers and must be handled separately.

SUMMARY:

Django supports text translation, formatting, and time zones.

Developers define what is translatable.

Localization is applied dynamically per user.

Language detection relies on HTTP headers.

SECTION: Core Terminology and Definitions

PURPOSE:
Define essential terms used throughout Django’s internationalization system.

CONCEPT:

Internationalization
Preparing software so it can be adapted to different languages and regions. This is primarily a developer responsibility.

Localization
Providing translated text and locale-specific formatting. This is primarily handled by translators.

SECTION: Locale and Language Identifiers

PURPOSE:
Clarify how Django identifies languages and regional formats.

CONCEPT:

Locale Name
A locale identifier specifies language alone or language combined with region.

Format:

ll (language only)

ll_CC (language and country)

Rules:

Language codes are lowercase.

Country codes are uppercase if two characters, title case if longer.

Uses underscore (_) as a separator.

Examples:

it

de_AT

pt_BR

sr_Latn

Language Code
Represents a language identifier used by browsers.

Format:

Lowercase language code

Uses dash (-) as a separator

Examples:

it

de-at

pt-br

The HTTP Accept-Language header is case-insensitive.

SECTION: Translation and Formatting Files

PURPOSE:
Explain the file types used for translations and locale-specific formatting.

CONCEPT:

FILE: .po message file
ROLE: Plain-text file containing translation strings for a single language.

FILE: format file (Python module)
ROLE: Defines date, time, and number formats for a specific locale.

Translation String
A literal value marked for translation within the application.

SUMMARY:

.po files store translated text.

Format files define locale-specific formatting.

Translation strings are explicit literals.

Each file targets a specific language or locale.

SECTION: Internationalization Control Setting

PURPOSE:
Explain how Django enables or disables translation functionality.

CONCEPT:

Translation behavior is controlled by the USE_I18N setting.

DO NOT confuse the name of the setting with its scope:

The setting controls translation.

The system includes both internationalization and localization.

This naming is a legacy artifact and does not reflect the full scope of Django’s i18n and l10n features.
