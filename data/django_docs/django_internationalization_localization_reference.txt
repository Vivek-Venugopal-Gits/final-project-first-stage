=========================
INTERNATIONALIZATION AND LOCALIZATION
=========================
SECTION: Overview

PURPOSE:
Enable a single Django application to serve content in multiple languages and regional formats.

CONCEPT:

Internationalization and localization allow web applications to adapt content to users’ linguistic and cultural preferences.

Django provides built-in support for:

Translation of text

Formatting of dates, times, and numbers

Time zone handling

These features work together to customize the user experience based on locale-specific preferences.

=========================
DJANGO’S ROLE IN I18N AND L10N
=========================
SECTION: Core Responsibilities

PURPOSE:
Explain what Django handles in the i18n/l10n process.

Django performs two primary functions:

Declaration Phase (Developer-Controlled)
Developers and template authors define which parts of the application:

Are translatable

Require locale-aware formatting

Localization Phase (Runtime-Controlled)
Django uses these definitions to localize the application for individual users based on preferences.

=========================
LANGUAGE, FORMAT, AND TIME ZONE SOURCES
=========================
SECTION: Locale Determination

PURPOSE:
Explain how Django determines user preferences.

Language and formatting
Derived from the browser’s Accept-Language HTTP header.

Time zone
Not automatically provided by browsers and must be handled separately.

Translation generally depends on the target language, while formatting depends on the target country or region.

=========================
TERMINOLOGY AND DEFINITIONS
=========================
SECTION: Key Definitions

PURPOSE:
Clarify commonly confused internationalization terms.

TERM: Internationalization (i18n)

DEFINITION:
The process of preparing software for localization.

RESPONSIBILITY:
Typically performed by developers.

TERM: Localization (l10n)

DEFINITION:
The process of writing translations and defining local formats.

RESPONSIBILITY:
Typically performed by translators or localization teams.

=========================
IMPORTANT SETTING WARNING
=========================
SECTION: USE_I18N Setting

WARNING:
Translation behavior is controlled by the USE_I18N setting.

Despite its name, this setting affects both internationalization and localization. The naming reflects historical design decisions in Django.

=========================
LOCALE AND LANGUAGE TERMINOLOGY
=========================
SECTION: Locale Name

DEFINITION:
A locale identifier describing a language or a language-country combination.

FORMAT:

Language only: ll

Language + country: ll_CC

RULES:

Language code: lowercase

Country code:

Uppercase if 2 characters

Titlecase if longer

Separator: underscore (_)

EXAMPLES:

it

de_AT

es

pt_BR

sr_Latn

SECTION: Language Code

DEFINITION:
Represents a language identifier sent by browsers in the Accept-Language header.

FORMAT:

Lowercase by convention

Case-insensitive in HTTP

Separator: dash (-)

EXAMPLES:

it

de-at

es

pt-br

=========================
TRANSLATION FILES
=========================
SECTION: Message File

DEFINITION:
A plain-text file containing all translatable strings for a single language.

FILE TYPE:
.po

CONTENTS:

Original text (message IDs)

Translated text for a specific language

SECTION: Translation String

DEFINITION:
A literal value in code or templates that can be translated.

=========================
FORMAT FILES
=========================
SECTION: Format File

DEFINITION:
A Python module defining locale-specific formatting rules.

RESPONSIBILITIES:

Date formats

Time formats

Number formats

Each locale can define its own format file to control presentation conventions.

=========================
SUMMARY
=========================
SUMMARY:

Django supports multilingual and locale-aware applications

Internationalization prepares the app for localization

Localization provides actual translations and formats

Language preferences come from Accept-Language

Time zones require separate handling

.po files store translations

Format files control regional presentation rules

Locale names and language codes follow distinct conventions
