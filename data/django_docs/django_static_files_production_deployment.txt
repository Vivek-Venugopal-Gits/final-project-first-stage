PURPOSE:
Explain how to prepare, collect, and serve Django static files in production environments using supported deployment patterns.

DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
APPLICABILITY:

Production Django deployments

Projects using django.contrib.staticfiles

SECTION: Overview of Static Files Deployment

PURPOSE:
Describe the high-level process for making static files available in production.

CONCEPT:

Deploying static files in Django production environments consists of two mandatory steps:

Run the collectstatic command whenever static files change.

Serve the collected static files from a dedicated location configured for static file delivery.

Static files are gathered into a single directory defined by STATIC_ROOT. Depending on the configured static files storage backend, files may need to be moved manually or processed automatically by the storage backend.

Every production deployment differs. The deployment patterns described below illustrate common approaches that must be adapted to individual infrastructure requirements.

SECTION: Core Static Files Settings

PURPOSE:
Define the critical settings involved in static files deployment.

FILE: STATIC_ROOT
ROLE: Absolute filesystem path where all collected static files are stored for production serving.

FILE: STATIC_URL
ROLE: Public URL prefix used to serve static files.

FILE: STORAGES["staticfiles"]
ROLE: Defines the storage backend used by django.contrib.staticfiles during collection and deployment.

SECTION: Collecting Static Files

PURPOSE:
Explain how static files are aggregated for production use.

COMMAND:
CODE:
collectstatic

CONCEPT:

The collectstatic command gathers static files from all installed apps and configured static directories and places them into STATIC_ROOT. If a custom storage backend is configured, it may automatically handle file transfer or post-processing.

USAGE GUIDELINES:

USE WHEN:

Static files are added, changed, or removed

Preparing a deployment artifact for production

DO NOT USE WHEN:

Serving static files directly from source directories in production

SECTION: Serving Static Files from the Same Server

PURPOSE:
Describe how to serve static files from the same server that runs Django.

CONCEPT:

In this deployment pattern, the web server responsible for serving the Django application also serves static files.

Typical workflow:

Deploy application code to the server.

Run collectstatic on the server to populate STATIC_ROOT.

Configure the web server to serve files from STATIC_ROOT under STATIC_URL.

This process should be automated when managing multiple servers or frequent deployments.

USAGE GUIDELINES:

USE WHEN:

Running small to medium deployments

Infrastructure simplicity is prioritized

DO NOT USE WHEN:

High traffic or large-scale static file delivery is required

SECTION: Serving Static Files from a Dedicated Server

PURPOSE:
Explain how to offload static file serving to a separate server.

CONCEPT:

Larger deployments commonly use a separate web server that does not run Django to serve static files. These servers are typically optimized for static content delivery.

Typical workflow:

Run collectstatic locally or in a build environment.

Transfer the contents of STATIC_ROOT to the static file server.

Serve files directly from the static server.

File synchronization tools are commonly used to transfer only changed files.

USAGE GUIDELINES:

USE WHEN:

Scaling static file delivery independently from Django

Optimizing performance for large static assets

DO NOT USE WHEN:

Deployment simplicity outweighs performance considerations

SECTION: Serving Static Files from Cloud Storage or a CDN

PURPOSE:
Describe static file deployment using cloud storage providers or CDNs.

CONCEPT:

Static files can be served from cloud-based storage services or content delivery networks (CDNs). This approach removes the need to manage static file servers and often improves load performance.

Instead of transferring files to a server, static files are uploaded to the storage provider using a storage backend API.

Custom or third-party storage backends can be configured to integrate Django with cloud storage providers.

FILE: STORAGES["staticfiles"]
ROLE: Specifies the storage backend responsible for uploading and managing static files.

COMMAND:
CODE:
STORAGES = {
    # ...
    "staticfiles": {"BACKEND": "myproject.storage.S3Storage"}
}


After configuration, running collectstatic uploads static files using the configured backend. Changing providers typically requires only updating the storage backend configuration.

USAGE GUIDELINES:

USE WHEN:

Serving static files globally

Minimizing infrastructure management

Leveraging CDN caching and performance

DO NOT USE WHEN:

Storage provider APIs are unavailable

Static files must remain strictly on local infrastructure

SECTION: Extending Static Files with Custom Storage Backends

PURPOSE:
Explain how Django supports extensible static file storage implementations.

CONCEPT:

Django allows custom storage backends to control how static files are stored, processed, and transferred. These backends integrate with collectstatic and can automate post-processing and deployment.

Third-party storage backends exist for many common storage services and APIs.

SUMMARY:

Static files must be collected before production deployment.

STATIC_ROOT defines where collected files are stored.

Static files can be served from the same server, a dedicated server, or cloud storage/CDNs.

Storage backends control how static files are processed and transferred.

collectstatic is the central command for static file deployment.
