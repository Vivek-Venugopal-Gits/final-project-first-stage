SECTION: Django Class-Based Views API Overview
PURPOSE:
Provides reference for Django's built-in class-based views, organized by category, with introductory material on usage and structure.
​
DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
APPLICABILITY:

Covers versions from 1.8 to dev, with primary focus on 6.0.
​
CONCEPT: Specification
Each request served by a class-based view has an independent state, making it safe to store state variables on the instance, such as self.foo = 3.
​
A class-based view deploys into a URL pattern using the as_view() classmethod.
​
COMMAND:
python
urlpatterns = [  
    path("view/", MyView.as_view(size=42)),  
]  
USAGE GUIDELINES:
USE WHEN:

Deploying class-based views in URL configurations.
​
DO NOT USE WHEN:

Passing mutable objects like lists or dictionaries as arguments, as they share state across instances and can affect other users.
​
Arguments passed to as_view() assign to the instance and must correspond to existing class attributes.
​
SECTION: Base vs Generic Views
PURPOSE:
Explains relationship between base views, mixins, and generic views for common patterns.
​
Base class-based views serve as parent views that can be used alone or inherited from, with mixins extending their capabilities.
​
Generic views build on base views to abstract common idioms like displaying object details, reducing repetition, and often require a queryset QuerySet.
​
SECTION: View Categories
Base views: View, TemplateView, RedirectView.
​
Generic display views: DetailView, ListView.
​
Generic editing views: FormView, CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView.
​
Generic date views: ArchiveIndexView, YearArchiveView, MonthArchiveView, WeekArchiveView, DayArchiveView, TodayArchiveView, DateDetailView.
​
Mixins: Organized into simple, single object, multiple object, editing, and date-based categories.
​
Flattened index: Lists all simple generic, detail, list, editing, and date-based views.
​
SUMMARY:
Class-based views ensure thread safety via independent request states.
​
Deploy with as_view() in URL patterns, avoiding mutable args.
​
Generic views abstract common patterns; most need a queryset.
