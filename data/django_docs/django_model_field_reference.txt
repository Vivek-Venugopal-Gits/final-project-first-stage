PURPOSE: This section provides API references for Field, including options and types, and notes on custom fields and third-party packages.
DO NOT use built-in fields if they do not fit; use django-localflavor for locale-specific needs or create custom fields.
Fields are in django.db.models.fields, imported as from django.db import models for convenience.
DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
APPLICABILITY: - Defining database columns in models.

SECTION: Field Options
PURPOSE: This section details optional arguments available to all field types.
All arguments are optional unless specified.
CONCEPT: null
If True, store empty values as NULL in database. Default is False.
DO NOT use null on string-based fields like CharField and TextField; use empty string for no data.
If CharField has unique=True and blank=True, set null=True to avoid unique violations on blank values.
On Oracle, NULL stores empty strings regardless.
DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
APPLICABILITY: - Controlling database NULL values.
USAGE GUIDELINES:
USE WHEN:

Allowing database NULL for non-string fields.
DO NOT USE WHEN:
On string fields; prefer empty strings.

CONCEPT: blank
If True, allow blank values in validation. Default is False.
blank differs from null: blank is validation-related, null is database-related.
If blank=True, forms allow empty values; if blank=False, field is required.
If blank=True and null=False, implement clean() on model to supply missing values.
DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
APPLICABILITY: - Controlling form validation for empty values.
USAGE GUIDELINES:
USE WHEN:

Permitting empty inputs in forms.
DO NOT USE WHEN:
Field must always have a value.

CONCEPT: choices
A mapping, sequence of 2-tuples, enumeration, or callable returning such, for field choices.
Enforces choices in model validation; default form widget is select box.
Keys are database values; values are human-readable.
A new migration occurs if choices order changes.
Use get_FOO_display() for human-readable value.
DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
APPLICABILITY: - Limiting field inputs to predefined options.
COMMAND:
CODE:
YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = {
    "FR": "Freshman",
    "SO": "Sophomore",
    "JR": "Junior",
    "SR": "Senior",

    return {i: i for i in settings.CURRENCIES}

class Expense(models.Model):
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    currency = models.CharField(max_length=3, choices=get_currencies)
Define choices inside model class as constants for encapsulation.

        max_length=2,
        choices=YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES,
        default=FRESHMAN,
    )

    def is_upperclass(self):
        return self.year_in_school in {self.JUNIOR, self.SENIOR}
Group choices for organization.
COMMAND:
CODE:
MEDIA_CHOICES = {
    "Audio": {
        "vinyl": "Vinyl",
        "cd": "CD",
    },
    "Video": {
        "vhs": "VHS Tape",
        "dvd": "DVD",
    },
    "unknown": "Unknown",
}
Or as sequence:
COMMAND:
CODE:
MEDIA_CHOICES = [
    (
        "Audio",
        (
            ("vinyl", "Vinyl"),
            ("cd", "CD"),
        ),
    ),
    (
        "Video",
        (
            ("vhs", "VHS Tape"),
            ("dvd", "DVD"),
        ),
    ),
    ("unknown", "Unknown"),
]

        default=YearInSchool.FRESHMAN,
    )

    def is_upperclass(self):

            self.YearInSchool.JUNIOR,
            self.YearInSchool.SENIOR,
        }
