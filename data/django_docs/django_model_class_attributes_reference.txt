PURPOSE: This section covers features of the Model class, including its attributes for handling exceptions and managers.
DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
PYTHON VERSION: Not specified
APPLICABILITY:

Django ORM for model definitions and interactions.

SECTION: ATTRIBUTES
PURPOSE: This section details the attributes available on the Model class.
CONCEPT: DOESNOTEXIST ATTRIBUTE
This exception is raised by the ORM when an expected object is not found. For example, QuerySet.get() raises it when no object is found for the given lookups.
Django provides a DoesNotExist exception as an attribute of each model class to identify the class of object that could not be found, allowing catching exceptions for a particular model class. The exception is a subclass of django.core.exceptions.ObjectDoesNotExist.
USAGE GUIDELINES:
USE WHEN:

Handling cases where a query might not return an object.
DO NOT USE WHEN:
Expecting multiple objects; use MultipleObjectsReturned instead.

CONCEPT: MULTIPLEOBJECTSRETURNED ATTRIBUTE
This exception is raised by QuerySet.get() when multiple objects are found for the given lookups.
Django provides a MultipleObjectsReturned exception as an attribute of each model class to identify the class of object for which multiple objects were found, allowing catching exceptions for a particular model class. The exception is a subclass of django.core.exceptions.MultipleObjectsReturned.
USAGE GUIDELINES:
USE WHEN:

Handling queries that might return more than one object.
DO NOT USE WHEN:
Queries are designed to return multiple results; use QuerySet.filter() instead.

CONCEPT: NOTUPDATED ATTRIBUTE
This exception is raised when a forced update of a Model instance does not affect any rows.
Django provides a NotUpdated exception as an attribute of each model class to identify the class of object that could not be updated, allowing catching exceptions for a particular model class. The exception is a subclass of django.core.exceptions.ObjectNotUpdated and inherits from django.db.DatabaseError for backward compatibility reasons.
USAGE GUIDELINES:
USE WHEN:

Handling forced updates that might not modify rows.
DO NOT USE WHEN:
Standard saves or updates are sufficient.

CONCEPT: OBJECTS ATTRIBUTE
Each non-abstract Model class must have a Manager instance added to it. Django ensures that in the model class there is at least a default Manager specified. If no custom Manager is added, Django adds an attribute objects containing the default Manager instance. If a custom Manager instance attribute is added, the default one does not appear.
CODE EXAMPLE:
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    # Add manager with another name
    people = models.Manager()
USAGE GUIDELINES:
USE WHEN:

Accessing the default manager for querying models.
DO NOT USE WHEN:
Custom managers are defined; access them by their attribute names.

SUMMARY:

Use DoesNotExist for missing object exceptions.
Use MultipleObjectsReturned for excess object exceptions.
Use NotUpdated for failed forced updates.
Access objects for the default model manager.
