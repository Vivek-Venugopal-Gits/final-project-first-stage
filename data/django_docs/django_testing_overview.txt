PURPOSE: Introduce the importance and approach to automated testing in Django applications, covering validation of new code and protection during refactoring.
DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
Automated testing identifies bugs effectively.
A test suite solves:

Validation that new code behaves as expected.
Assurance that refactors or modifications do not introduce regressions.

Web application testing is complex due to multiple layers: request handling, queries/models, form processing, validation, and template rendering.
Django provides a test-execution framework and utilities to:

Simulate requests.
Insert test data.
Inspect application output.
Verify expected behavior.

Preferred test framework: Python's built-in unittest module.
Detailed coverage in separate sections.
Alternative Python test frameworks are supported via Django's integration API.

SECTION: Django testing structure
PURPOSE: Outline the main testing documentation sections.

Writing and running tests: Core guide using unittest.
Testing tools: Django-specific utilities and helpers.
Advanced testing topics: Integration with other frameworks and advanced techniques.


SUMMARY:

Use tests to validate new features and safeguard refactors.
Django simplifies testing multi-layer web applications.
Start with unittest-based tests; extend with tools and advanced features as needed.
