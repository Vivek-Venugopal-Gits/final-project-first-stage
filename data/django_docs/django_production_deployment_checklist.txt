PURPOSE:
Provide a comprehensive, production-focused checklist to secure, configure, and optimize a Django application before deployment.

DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
APPLICABILITY:

Production Django deployments

WSGI or ASGI-based server environments

SECTION: Deployment Threat Model and Configuration Strategy

PURPOSE:
Explain why deployment settings require careful review.

CONCEPT:

The public internet is a hostile environment. Django applications MUST be reviewed for security, performance, and operational correctness before deployment.

Django provides many built-in security features. Some are always enabled, while others are optional due to development inconvenience or environment-specific trade-offs. Examples include HTTPS enforcement, caching, and error reporting.

Deployment settings:

MUST be secured for production

OFTEN differ between development, staging, and production

MAY contain sensitive credentials and secrets

A common best practice is to publish development settings and keep production settings private.

SECTION: Automated Deployment Checks

PURPOSE:
Describe Django’s built-in deployment validation command.

COMMAND:
CODE:
manage.py check --deploy

CONCEPT:

The check --deploy command runs automated checks for common security and deployment misconfigurations.

USAGE GUIDELINES:

USE WHEN:

Validating production settings before deployment

Running CI/CD validation steps

DO NOT USE WHEN:

Testing development-only configurations

SECTION: Production Server Requirement

PURPOSE:
Clarify the requirement for a production-grade server.

CONCEPT:

The Django development server MUST NOT be used in production.

FILE: manage.py runserver
ROLE: Development-only server for local testing

Production deployments MUST use a WSGI or ASGI-compliant application server.

SECTION: Critical Security Settings

PURPOSE:
Define mandatory security-related configuration.

SECTION: SECRET_KEY Configuration

PURPOSE:
Explain secure handling of Django’s cryptographic secret.

FILE: SECRET_KEY
ROLE: Core cryptographic key used for signing cookies, tokens, and other security features

CONCEPT:

The secret key MUST be a large, random value.

The production secret key MUST NOT be reused elsewhere.

The secret key MUST NOT be committed to source control.

COMMAND:
CODE:
import os

SECRET_KEY = os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]


Alternative file-based loading:

with open("/etc/secret_key.txt") as f:
    SECRET_KEY = f.read().strip()

CONCEPT: Key Rotation

Django supports secret key rotation using fallback keys.

FILE: SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS
ROLE: List of previously valid secret keys

import os

SECRET_KEY = os.environ["CURRENT_SECRET_KEY"]
SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS = [
    os.environ["OLD_SECRET_KEY"],
]


Old keys MUST be removed from fallbacks promptly.

SECTION: DEBUG Configuration

PURPOSE:
Prevent sensitive data exposure in production.

FILE: DEBUG
ROLE: Controls debug output and error visibility

CONCEPT:

DEBUG MUST NEVER BE ENABLED IN PRODUCTION.

When enabled, Django exposes:

Source code snippets

Local variables

Installed packages

Internal settings

This represents a critical security risk.

SECTION: Environment-Specific Settings

PURPOSE:
Describe settings that vary by deployment environment.

SECTION: ALLOWED_HOSTS

PURPOSE:
Prevent host header attacks.

FILE: ALLOWED_HOSTS
ROLE: Whitelist of valid hostnames

CONCEPT:

When DEBUG = False, Django will not serve requests without ALLOWED_HOSTS defined.

Using a wildcard host requires custom validation of the Host header.

The front-end web server SHOULD reject invalid hosts before forwarding requests to Django.

SECTION: Cache Configuration

PURPOSE:
Ensure safe and effective caching.

FILE: CACHES
ROLE: Cache backend configuration

CONCEPT:

Development and production cache backends often differ.

Django defaults to per-process local memory caching.

Cache servers often lack strong authentication.

Cache servers MUST only accept connections from application servers.

SECTION: Database Configuration

PURPOSE:
Secure database connectivity.

FILE: DATABASES
ROLE: Database connection settings

CONCEPT:

Production and development databases differ.

Database passwords are highly sensitive.

Database servers MUST restrict network access.

Database backups MUST be configured before deployment.

SECTION: Email Backend Configuration

PURPOSE:
Ensure reliable outbound email delivery.

FILE: EMAIL_BACKEND
ROLE: Defines how Django sends emails

CONCEPT:

Default sender addresses may be rejected by email providers.

FILE: DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
ROLE: Default sender address for application emails

FILE: SERVER_EMAIL
ROLE: Sender address for error emails

These values MUST be explicitly set for production.

SECTION: Static Files Configuration

PURPOSE:
Enable proper static asset handling.

FILE: STATIC_ROOT
ROLE: Directory where collected static files are stored

FILE: STATIC_URL
ROLE: Public URL prefix for static files

CONCEPT:

Static files are auto-served only in development.

Production requires running collectstatic.

SECTION: Media Files Configuration

PURPOSE:
Secure user-uploaded content.

FILE: MEDIA_ROOT
ROLE: Storage location for uploaded files

FILE: MEDIA_URL
ROLE: Public URL prefix for media files

CONCEPT:

User-uploaded files are untrusted. The web server MUST NOT execute uploaded content.

Media files SHOULD be included in backup strategies.

SECTION: HTTPS Enforcement

PURPOSE:
Protect authentication and session data.

CONCEPT:

Any site that supports authentication MUST enforce site-wide HTTPS.

Session cookies are shared across HTTP and HTTPS. Partial HTTPS coverage is insufficient.

The web server MUST:

Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS

Forward only HTTPS requests to Django

SECTION: Secure Cookie Settings

PURPOSE:
Prevent accidental cookie leakage.

FILE: CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE
ROLE: Ensures CSRF cookie is sent only over HTTPS

FILE: SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE
ROLE: Ensures session cookie is sent only over HTTPS

CONCEPT:

Both settings MUST be set to True when HTTPS is enabled.

SECTION: Performance Optimizations

PURPOSE:
Improve runtime efficiency in production.

SECTION: Session Performance

PURPOSE:
Reduce session overhead.

CONCEPT:

Cached session backends can improve performance.

Database-backed sessions require regular cleanup.

SECTION: Persistent Database Connections

PURPOSE:
Reduce connection overhead.

FILE: CONN_MAX_AGE
ROLE: Enables persistent database connections

CONCEPT:

Persistent connections significantly improve performance when database connection time is non-trivial.

SECTION: Template Caching

PURPOSE:
Reduce template rendering overhead.

FILE: TEMPLATES
ROLE: Template engine configuration

CONCEPT:

When DEBUG = False, Django automatically enables the cached template loader, preventing repetitive template compilation.

SECTION: Error Reporting Configuration

PURPOSE:
Ensure visibility into production failures.

SECTION: Logging Configuration

PURPOSE:
Capture runtime diagnostics.

FILE: LOGGING
ROLE: Controls logging output and handlers

CONCEPT:

Logging MUST be reviewed and validated after production traffic begins.

SECTION: Admin and Manager Notifications

PURPOSE:
Enable email-based error alerts.

FILE: ADMINS
ROLE: Receives email notifications for HTTP 500 errors

FILE: MANAGERS
ROLE: Receives email notifications for HTTP 404 errors

FILE: IGNORABLE_404_URLS
ROLE: Filters irrelevant 404 error reports

CONCEPT:

Email-based error reporting does not scale well and may overwhelm inboxes in high-traffic systems.

SECTION: Custom Error Pages

PURPOSE:
Improve user-facing error responses.

CONCEPT:

Django supports custom error templates:

FILE: 404.html
FILE: 500.html
FILE: 403.html
FILE: 400.html

Default error views are sufficient for most applications but can be customized if needed.

SUMMARY:

Production settings must prioritize security, stability, and performance.

DEBUG must always be disabled in production.

Secrets and credentials must be protected and externalized.

HTTPS enforcement is mandatory for authenticated sites.

Logging and error reporting must be configured before launch.
