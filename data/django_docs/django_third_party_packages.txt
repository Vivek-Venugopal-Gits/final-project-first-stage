SECTION: Tutorial Overview - Writing Your First Django App, Part 8
PURPOSE:
This section concludes the beginner tutorial by introducing third-party packages, highlighting Django's ecosystem strength, and demonstrating installation of Django Debug Toolbar as an example.
SECTION: Django's Third-Party Ecosystem
CONCEPT:
Django excels due to its rich community-developed third-party packages. These reusable components quickly add features to applications.
Discover packages via Django Packages, a directory comparing reusable apps, sites, tools, and more.
SECTION: Installing Django Debug Toolbar
CONCEPT:
Django Debug Toolbar ranks highly in developer surveys (second in 2025 with 27% of top favorites). Community-maintained by Django Commons, it displays panels with debug info on requests/responses for development debugging.
Install in activated virtual environment.
COMMAND:
python -m pip install django-debug-toolbar
Current version (as of December 2025) is around 6.x, supporting Django ≥4.2.
Post-installation setup includes:

Adding "debug_toolbar" to INSTALLED_APPS.
Adding DebugToolbarMiddleware to MIDDLEWARE.
Including debug_toolbar.urls in project URLconf.
Configuring INTERNAL_IPS.

Follow official installation guide for exact steps, as they evolve independently of Django.
Once set up, toolbar appears as a handle on the right in development browser views (e.g., /admin/). Click to open panels.
USAGE GUIDELINES:
USE WHEN:

Local development for inspecting SQL queries, performance, templates, etc.
DO NOT USE WHEN:
Production; disable via DEBUG=False or conditional checks.

SECTION: Troubleshooting and Getting Help
CONCEPT:
For issues (e.g., toolbar not appearing):

Check package documentation (e.g., Tips/Troubleshooting section).
Search issue tracker (GitHub for Django Debug Toolbar).
Ask on Django Forum or Discord.

SECTION: Selecting and Installing Other Packages
CONCEPT:
Choose packages based on needs: alpha for experimentation, stable for production.
Evaluate maintenance: recent updates, activity, documentation, best practices.
Django Packages displays metrics like last update.
Gaps in packages offer contribution opportunities.
SUMMARY:

Ecosystem enables rapid feature addition.
Install via pip; configure per package docs.
Prioritize well-maintained packages.
Use community resources for support.
