SECTION: django.contrib.humanize Overview

PURPOSE:
Describe Django’s built-in humanization filters used to present numeric and date values in a more human-readable format.

CONCEPT:

django.contrib.humanize provides template filters that transform raw numbers and dates into formats commonly used in natural language. These filters operate only at the template layer and do not modify underlying data.

ACTIVATION REQUIREMENT:

To use these filters:

The application MUST be included in INSTALLED_APPS

The template MUST load the library explicitly

COMMAND:
{% load humanize %}

SECTION: Spelled-Out Numbers
FILTER: apnumber

PURPOSE:
Convert small integers into their spelled-out English equivalents following Associated Press style.

CONCEPT:

Numbers from 1 to 9 are converted to words

All other values are returned unchanged

EXAMPLES:

1 → one

2 → two

10 → 10

INPUT TYPES:

Integer

String representation of an integer

SECTION: Comma-Separated Numbers
FILTER: intcomma

PURPOSE:
Format large numbers with thousands separators for readability.

CONCEPT:

Inserts separators every three digits

Supports integers, floats, and numeric strings

Respects format localization when enabled

EXAMPLES:

4500 → 4,500

4500.2 → 4,500.2

4500000 → 4,500,000

LOCALIZATION BEHAVIOR:

When localization is enabled:

Separators follow the active locale’s numeric conventions

SECTION: Large Number Words
FILTER: intword

PURPOSE:
Convert large numbers into abbreviated human-readable phrases.

CONCEPT:

Designed for values ≥ 1,000,000

Uses singular for 1.0, plural for all other values

Supports values up to 10¹⁰⁰ (Googol)

Negative values preserve sign

EXAMPLES:

1000000 → 1.0 million

1200000 → 1.2 million

1200000000 → 1.2 billion

-1200000000 → -1.2 billion

LOCALIZATION BEHAVIOR:

Number formatting and language reflect active locale

Pluralization may not be linguistically perfect in all languages

SECTION: Human-Friendly Dates
FILTER: naturalday

PURPOSE:
Replace absolute dates with relative day terms when applicable.

CONCEPT:

Detects proximity to the current date

Outputs relative labels for near dates

Falls back to formatted date for others

RELATIVE OUTPUTS:

Today

Tomorrow

Yesterday

FORMAT ARGUMENT:

Accepts a date format string

Defaults to DATE_FORMAT if no argument is provided

SECTION: Human-Friendly Time Differences
FILTER: naturaltime

PURPOSE:
Express datetime values as relative time differences.

CONCEPT:

Uses seconds, minutes, and hours for recent times

Falls back to timesince format after one day

Automatically handles future datetimes

EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:

now

29 seconds ago

a minute ago

4 minutes ago

an hour ago

1 day, 2 hours ago

30 seconds from now

2 hours from now

1 week, 2 days from now

USAGE GUIDELINES:

USE WHEN:

Displaying timestamps to end users

Showing relative freshness or delay

DO NOT USE WHEN:

Exact timestamps are required for auditing or logging

SECTION: Ordinal Numbers
FILTER: ordinal

PURPOSE:
Convert integers into ordinal string representations.

CONCEPT:

Appends English ordinal suffixes

Negative integers are returned unchanged

EXAMPLES:

1 → 1st

2 → 2nd

3 → 3rd

INPUT TYPES:

Integer

String representation of an integer

SECTION: Activation and Loading Requirements
CONCEPT:

Humanize filters are not available by default. They require both application registration and template loading.

REQUIRED STEPS:

Add django.contrib.humanize to INSTALLED_APPS

Load the library in templates

COMMAND:
{% load humanize %}

SECTION: Usage Characteristics
CONCEPT:

Filters operate only in templates

They do not mutate source values

Output depends on localization and current date/time context

SUMMARY:

django.contrib.humanize improves readability of numbers and dates

Filters are template-only and presentation-focused

Localization affects numeric and linguistic output

Explicit activation and loading are required
