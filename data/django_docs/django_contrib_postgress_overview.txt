PURPOSE: Describe the purpose and scope of the optional django.contrib.postgres module, which provides PostgreSQL-specific features in Django.
DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
APPLICABILITY:

Requires PostgreSQL as the database backend
Features are PostgreSQL-exclusive and not portable to other databases

Django maintains a database-agnostic core. Prefer database-agnostic code for reusable applications.
Real-world projects may commit to PostgreSQL due to migration costs at scale.
The django.contrib.postgres module adds model fields, form fields, and other extensions for PostgreSQL-specific data types and capabilities.
PostgreSQL offers the richest feature set among supported databases, providing the most benefits from backend-specific extensions.
No equivalent modules exist for other databases (e.g., contrib.mysql) primarily due to PostgreSQL's advanced features.

SUMMARY:
django.contrib.postgres is optional and PostgreSQL-only.
It extends Django with advanced fields, indexes, search, aggregates, and more.
Use for projects committed to PostgreSQL to leverage its unique capabilities.
Always prioritize database-agnostic design where possible.
