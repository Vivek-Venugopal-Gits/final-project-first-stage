PURPOSE: Describes Django's framework for generating RSS and Atom feeds.
Django provides a high-level syndication-feed-generating framework for creating RSS and Atom feeds. Write a Python class to create feeds. Also includes a lower-level API for custom generation outside web contexts.
SECTION: HIGH-LEVEL FRAMEWORK
PURPOSE: Explains creating feeds using the Feed class.
The Feed class represents a syndication feed. Subclass it and point to an instance in URLconf. Feeds can be simple or complex based on URL arguments.
SECTION: SIMPLE FEED EXAMPLE
PURPOSE: Demonstrates a basic feed for latest news items.
COMMAND:
CODE:
from django.contrib.syndication.views import Feed
from django.urls import reverse
from policebeat.models import NewsItem

class LatestEntriesFeed(Feed):
    title = "Police beat site news"
    link = "/sitenews/"
    description = "Updates on changes and additions to police beat central."

    def items(self):
        return NewsItem.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]

    def item_title(self, item):
        return item.title

    def item_description(self, item):
        return item.description

    # item_link is only needed if NewsItem has no get_absolute_url method.
    def item_link(self, item):
        return reverse("news-item", args=[item.pk])
URLconf:
COMMAND:
CODE:
from django.urls import path
from myproject.feeds import LatestEntriesFeed

urlpatterns = [
    path("latest/feed/", LatestEntriesFeed()),
]
title, link, description correspond to RSS elements. items returns list of objects. item_title/description use object string if not defined. item_link uses get_absolute_url if available.
For Atom, set subtitle instead of description.
SECTION: COMPLEX FEED EXAMPLE
PURPOSE: Shows feeds varying by URL arguments, like police beats.
URLconf: path("beats/<int:beat_id>/rss/", BeatFeed()),
COMMAND:
CODE:
from django.contrib.syndication.views import Feed

class BeatFeed(Feed):
    description_template = "feeds/beat_description.html"

    def get_object(self, request, beat_id):
        return Beat.objects.get(pk=beat_id)

    def title(self, obj):
        return "Police beat central: Crimes for beat %s" % obj.beat

    def link(self, obj):
        return obj.get_absolute_url()

    def description(self, obj):
        return "Crimes recently reported in police beat %s" % obj.beat

    def items(self, obj):
        return Crime.objects.filter(beat=obj).order_by("-crime_date")[:30]
get_object retrieves object from URL args. title/link/description/items use obj.
Template for description: {{ obj.description }}
SECTION: SPECIFYING FEED TYPE
PURPOSE: Changes default RSS 2.0 to other formats.
Set feed_type to class like Atom1Feed.
COMMAND:
CODE:
from django.utils.feedgenerator import Atom1Feed

class MyFeed(Feed):
    feed_type = Atom1Feed
Available: Rss201rev2Feed (default), RssUserland091Feed, Atom1Feed.
SECTION: ENCLOSURES
PURPOSE: Adds enclosures for podcasts.
Use item_enclosures (list of Enclosure) or item_enclosure_url/length/mime_type.
See Feed reference for examples.
SECTION: LANGUAGE
PURPOSE: Sets feed language.
Defaults to get_language(). Set language attribute.
COMMAND:
CODE:
class MyFeed(Feed):
    language = "de"
SECTION: URLS
PURPOSE: Handles absolute/relative URLs.
link inserts domain from SITE_ID if relative. Atom adds <link rel="self"> using SITE_ID.
SECTION: PUBLISHING ATOM AND RSS IN TANDEM
PURPOSE: Offers both formats.
Subclass and change feed_type; add to URLconf.
COMMAND:
CODE:
from django.contrib.syndication.views import Feed
from django.utils.feedgenerator import Atom1Feed

class RssSiteNewsFeed(Feed):
    title = "Police beat site news"
    link = "/sitenews/"
    description = "Updates on changes and additions to police beat central."

    def items(self):
        return NewsItem.objects.order_by("-pub_date")[:5]

class AtomSiteNewsFeed(RssSiteNewsFeed):
    feed_type = Atom1Feed
    subtitle = RssSiteNewsFeed.description
URLconf:
COMMAND:
CODE:
from django.urls import path
from myproject.feeds import AtomSiteNewsFeed, RssSiteNewsFeed

urlpatterns = [
    path("sitenews/rss/", RssSiteNewsFeed()),
    path("sitenews/atom/", AtomSiteNewsFeed()),
]
Use subtitle for Atom.

SUMMARY:

Subclass Feed for custom feeds.
Use methods for dynamic data.
Templates for title/description.
get_object for URL params.

SECTION: LOW-LEVEL FRAMEWORK
PURPOSE: Details lower-level API for XML generation.
In django.utils.feedgenerator. Use for non-web or custom feeds.

Methods:
init(title, link, description, language=None, author_email=None, ...)
add_item(title, link, description, author_email=None, ...)
write(outfile, encoding)
writeString(encoding)
CONCEPT: CUSTOM FEED GENERATORS
Subclass SyndicationFeed for custom formats.
Or extend Rss/Atom and override: root_attributes, add_root_elements, item_attributes, add_item_elements.
Call super() in overrides.
Example for iTunes:
