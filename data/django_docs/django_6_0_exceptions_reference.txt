NON_FIELD_ERRORS: Key for ValidationError instances not tied to specific fields in form/model dictionaries.

CONCEPT: BadRequest
Raised for unprocessable client request errors. Returns HttpResponseBadRequest at handler level.

CONCEPT: RequestAborted
Raised when HTTP body read interrupted by client disconnect or timeout. Internal to HTTP handlers.

CONCEPT: SynchronousOnlyOperation
Raised when synchronous-only code called from async context. Use asgiref.sync.sync_to_async() for async calls.

SECTION: URL RESOLVER EXCEPTIONS: Defined in django.urls for URL matching.
Handle URL resolution failures.

CONCEPT: Resolver404
Raised by resolve() when path doesn't map to view. Subclass of Http404.

SUMMARY:
Core exceptions in django.core.exceptions handle most Django operations

ObjectDoesNotExist/MultipleObjectsReturned catch model-specific variants

SuspiciousOperation subclasses cover security issues

Database exceptions wrap backend-specific errors with cause

Use sync_to_async() for async/synchronous operation conflicts
