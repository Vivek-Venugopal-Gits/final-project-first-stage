PURPOSE: Provide high-level guidance on deploying Django applications to production, focusing on server interfaces, static files, error reporting, and security checks.
DJANGO VERSION: 6.0
Ease of deployment is a core Django goal.
Deployment choices depend on architecture and business needs.
Django requires a web server; runserver is only for development.
Supported interfaces:

WSGI: Synchronous standard (main Python web server communication protocol).
ASGI: Asynchronous standard (supports async Python and future async Django features).

Additional considerations:

Static files handling.
Error reporting.
Deployment checklist for production readiness.


SECTION: WSGI deployment
PURPOSE: Deploy synchronous Django applications using WSGI servers.
Options:

Gunicorn
uWSGI
Apache with mod_wsgi
Apache authentication against Django users
The application callable
Settings module configuration
Applying WSGI middleware


SECTION: ASGI deployment
PURPOSE: Deploy asynchronous-capable Django applications using ASGI servers.
Options:

Daphne
Hypercorn
Uvicorn
The application callable
Settings module configuration
Applying ASGI middleware


SECTION: Deployment checklist
PURPOSE: Ensure production configurations are secure and performant.
Run manage.py check --deploy for automated checks.
Key areas:

Replace runserver with production server.
Critical settings (SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=False, ALLOWED_HOSTS, DATABASES).
Environment-specific settings.
HTTPS enforcement.
Performance optimizations (caching, compression, database tuning).
Error reporting configuration.


SUMMARY:

Use WSGI for synchronous deployments; ASGI for async support.
Handle static files separately in production.
Follow the deployment checklist and run check --deploy.
Choose server based on needs (Gunicorn/uWSGI common for WSGI; Daphne/Uvicorn for ASGI).
