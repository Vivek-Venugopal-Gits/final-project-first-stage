SECTION: Tutorial Overview - Writing Your First Django App, Part 6
PURPOSE:
This section continues the poll application tutorial by adding static files like stylesheets and images for customization.
SECTION: Static Files Concept
CONCEPT:
Static files include images, JavaScript, and CSS needed for web page rendering. Django's django.contrib.staticfiles collects these from apps into a single location for serving.
For small projects, serve directly; for larger ones, manage multiple app static files.
SECTION: Setting Up Static Files Directory
CONCEPT:
Create a static directory in the app (e.g., polls/static). Django finds static files via STATICFILES_FINDERS, including AppDirectoriesFinder which looks for static subdirectories in INSTALLED_APPS.
Namespace files by creating an app-named subdirectory (e.g., polls/static/polls).
USAGE GUIDELINES:
USE WHEN:

Serving non-dynamic assets like CSS or images.
DO NOT USE WHEN:
Files are generated dynamically; handle those separately.

SECTION: Adding a Stylesheet
CONCEPT:
Create style.css in polls/static/polls.
Code for polls/static/polls/style.css:
textli a {
    color: green;
}
Load in template using {% static %} tag.
Code for polls/templates/polls/index.html:
text{% load static %}

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'polls/style.css' %}">
{% static %} generates absolute URLs for static files.
COMMAND:
Bashpython manage.py runserver
Reload /polls/ to see changes.
SECTION: Adding a Background Image
CONCEPT:
Create images subdirectory in polls/static/polls and add background.png.
Update stylesheet:
Code for polls/static/polls/style.css:
textbody {
    background: white url("images/background.png") no-repeat;
}
Reload page to view.
USAGE GUIDELINES:
DO NOT USE WHEN:

Linking static files in non-Django-generated static files; use relative paths instead.

SUMMARY:

Static files enhance rendering.
Namespace for app specificity.
Use {% static %} in templates.
Relative paths in static files.
